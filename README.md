#Factura y pedidos online

"El bar de la esquina" is one of the first online bars where you can find out your spending before entering our establishment. This idea arises due to the proposed test of the Karbo College corresponding to the FP of Development apps. In addition, the web administrator can access to modify, create, delete and view the local dishes is a few clicks. The design of the web is supported with Boostrap, which allows us a more visual design, besides being able to be seen from any device. The main technologies are: PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
